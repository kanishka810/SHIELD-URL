Phishing URL Detection System

A web-based tool to detect phishing URLs using full-stack development.

Overview:

This project aims to detect phishing URLs using full-stack development. The goal is to classify URLs as either legitimate or phishing based on various features such as the structure of the URL, domain name, and patterns commonly found in phishing attempts.

Phishing is a type of cybercrime where attackers impersonate legitimate websites to steal sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, or credit card details. This project uses full-stack development to build a complete application that allows users to detect and avoid phishing URLs.

Features and Description:

The Phishing URL Detector is a web-based tool designed to detect and identify malicious or potentially hazardous URLs used in phishing attacks.

Phishing attacks are a serious cybersecurity risk, where criminals pose as trustworthy websites to steal sensitive data, including credit card numbers, usernames, and passwords.

This project provides a user-friendly platform that allows people to verify the security of URLs before engaging with them. Users will be able to enter URLs into the website's frontend, and the backend system will evaluate them to determine their safety or potential threat.
